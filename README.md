## Playgrounds
Code playgrounds allow you to test code without creating a project, also good examples can be found of other programmers code.
* [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net)
* [Plunker](https://plnkr.co)
* [Codepen](http://codepen.io)


## Leaning Resources
* [Coderwars](https://www.codewars.com/) - Train with coding challenges. This is a fun way to learn and compare your code with others. Found using something like Plunker was essential to test the code first. 
* [Egghead](https://egghead.io) - A _fremium_ service but some very good free videos here
* [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/all) - Some interesting courses here but expensive.
* [udacity](https://www.udacity.com)


## Angular
* Use a seed project - [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) This provides a simple way to get a project up and running.
* Follow the style guides - [angular-styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide)
